Web Audio Demo List
=========

A list of Web Audio API demos and applications.

In the future, this will become an attractive page, but for now, it's
just this README.

# Contributing

[Chris Lowis](http://github.com/chrislo), or
[post to the W3C Web Audio mailing list](mailto:public-audio@w3.org).

# Demos

## Demos using the standard AudioContext

These applications use the un-prefixed version of the API as described in the spec, and as such should work on standards-compliant implementations of Web Audio.

## Demos not yet using the standard AudioContext

These are some of the demos we know which were built with the prefixed webkitAudioContext.

We will endeavour to contact their developers and help them change their implementation to use the standard AudioContext. Apps which get updated to use AudioContext will be moved to the list above, others will be removed from the list if we cannot get them updated within a few months.

### Infinite Jukebox

“With The Infinite Jukebox, you can create a never-ending and ever changing version of any song.   The app works by sending your uploaded track over to The Echo Nest, where it is decomposed into individual beats.  Each beat is then analyzed and matched to other similar sounding beats in the song. ”
