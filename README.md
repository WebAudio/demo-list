# Web Audio/MIDI Demo List

This is where the W3C Audio WG used to keep a list of [demos or interesting applications of the Web Audio/MIDI APIs](http://webaudio.github.io/demo-list/).


## Contributing

We are no longer accepting new contributions now.  We suggest submitting your interesting applications to other places, such as the [WebAudio Weekly](http://www.webaudioweekly.com/about/).

We thank everyone who has contributed demos already, and we regret not taking any more for those who have recently submitted new demos.  This is not a judgement on the quality of the demos; we simply lack the time to manage this anymore.
